# opencucina

A collection of useful utilities, microservices, libraries etc. helping to build an enterprise application.

Notable is a workflow engine and a service wrapping it allowing to be cloud-deployed.

Better description on the [wiki](https://github.com/cucina/opencucina/wiki)

Another aspect is a distributed conversation framework allowing for multiple (micro)services to participate in a coordinated conversation 
where each participant is running a local transaction and transactional control is synchronised between them. 
Currently testing with only two participants.
